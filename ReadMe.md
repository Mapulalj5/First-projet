# First Project

This is my very first project on GitHub!  
I'm learning how to create and manage repositories, upload files, and write documentation — all from my phone!

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to get comfortable using GitHub and understand how to manage simple digital content or code online.

## Tools Used
- GitHub (Mobile version)
- My phone (because my laptop crashed!)

## Author

## Status
Still learning and adding more — stay tuned!
